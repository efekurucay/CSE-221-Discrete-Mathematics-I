### Topological Order
- Putting in a order, all arrow shows east
- To order graph, it should have no cycle.
- *acsyclic* is a graph without cycles.
- Every acyclic graph contains at least one node with zero in-degree.  
**NOTE:** When dealing complexity of a grapsh algorithms, consider both edges and vertices.
- Sparse and dense grapsh is defined with considering ratio edge/vertices.
